## About Me

I'm a PhD student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) working on the boundary between High Dimensional Statistics, Computer Science and Statistical Physics. 
My research focuses on one side to understand the proprites of adversarial/robust estimators in the high dimensional case (where both the number of data used and the dimension of this estimator diverge). On the other side, I am interested in making the non-rigourous but surprisingly effective methods of statistical physics rigorous increasing the toolbox that can be used to study high dimensional problems.

I am lucky to be mentored by [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/) and to share the lab with all the other [IdePHICS](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/idephics/) memebers. 

Outide of my research I spend most of my time climbing either small rocks, medium walls or big mountains. I also enjoy reading and listening to music.
