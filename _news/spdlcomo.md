Next week I will be attending the [Statistical Physics of Deep Learning school](https://spdl2.lakecomoschool.org/) in Como, Italy. I will present our work "A High Dimensional Statistical Model for Adversarial Training: Geometry and Trade-offs" during the poster session. I can't wait to follow the lectures from Francesca Mastrogiuseppe and Mathieu Wyart!
